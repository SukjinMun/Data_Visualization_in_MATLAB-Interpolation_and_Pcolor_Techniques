The MATLAB codes in this repo are about using interpolation and the pcolor function to analyze and visualize experimental data. Interpolation is used to fill in gaps in the data, helping us understand trends and patterns by creating a smoother picture from scattered data points. The pcolor function is key for visualization. It makes 2D color maps where colors represent the value of a third variable, like intensity. This is really helpful when one has a lot of data points or need to see changes in a specific value clearly. Together, these tools help turn complex data into easier-to-understand visual formats.
