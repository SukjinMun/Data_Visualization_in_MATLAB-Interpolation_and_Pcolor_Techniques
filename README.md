The provided MATLAB codes enhance data visualization in experimental analysis using interpolation and the pcolor function. Interpolation creates a continuous surface from discrete data points, making it easier to discern trends and patterns. The pcolor function generates pseudocolor plots that effectively represent three-dimensional data in two dimensions, using color to indicate the intensity of a third variable. This approach is particularly useful for analyzing complex datasets, especially in experiments with dense data points or where variations in intensity are significant.
